This is my first post, how exciting! 🎉

In this blog I will write about my adventures in the world of coding and indie hacking by sharing tutorials, tips and tricks, and updates on my projects.

But who am I?
I am a software engineer from Italy, I have a BsC in Data Science & AI and I am currently working as a backend developer for a startup in Italy.
On the side of my 9-5 job, I am working on my own projects with the goal of becoming a full-time indie hacker.

I hope you will enjoy my content and that you will find it useful for your own projects.

Stay tuned for more posts!

Ciao! 👋
